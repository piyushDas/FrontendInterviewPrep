            Some very usefule extracts - 

            RULE OF THREE
            Fitness of purpose - how is the pattern considered successful?
            Usefulness - why is the pattern considered successful?
            Applicability - is the design worthy of being a pattern because it has wider applicability?
                            If so, this needs to be explained. When reviewing or defining a pattern,
                            it is important to keep the above in mind.


            A design pattern should have a:
                - Pattern name and a description
                - Context outline – the contexts in which the pattern is effective in responding to the users needs.
                - Problem statement – a statement of the problem being addressed so we can understand the intent of the pattern.
                - Solution – a description of how the user’s problem is being solved in an understandable list of steps and perceptions.
                - Design – a description of the pattern’s design and in particular, the user’s behavior in interacting with it
                - Implementation – a guide to how the pattern would be implemented
                - Illustrations – a visual representation of classes in the pattern (e.g. a diagram)
                - Examples – an implementation of the pattern in a minimal form
                - Co-requisites – what other patterns may be needed to support use of the pattern being described?
                - Relations – what patterns does this pattern resemble? does it closely mimic any others?
                - Known usage – is the pattern being used in the wild? If so, where and how?
                - Discussions – the team or author’s thoughts on the exciting benefits of the pattern


            Anti-Patterns:
                - Describe a bad solution to a particular problem which resulted in a bad situation occurring
                - Describe how to get out of said situation and how to go from there to a good solution


            Examples of anti-patterns in JavaScript are the following:
            - Polluting the global namespace by defining a large number of variables in the global context
            - Passing strings rather than functions to either setTimeout or setInterval as this triggers the use of eval() internally.
            - Modifying the Object class prototype (this is a particularly bad anti-pattern)
            - Using JavaScript in an inline form as this is inflexible
            - The use of document.write where native DOM alternatives such as document.createElement are more appropriate.
              document.write has been grossly misused over the years and has quite a few disadvantages including that
              if it's executed after the page has been loaded it can actually overwrite the page we're on, whilst document.createElement does not.
              It also doesn't work with XHTML which is another reason opting for more DOM-friendly methods such as document.createElement is favorable.
        
            TYPES OF DESIGN PATTERNS

                - Prototype
                - Singleton
